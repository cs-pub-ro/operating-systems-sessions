# Session 01: The Software Stack

This session is about what sits between a C program and the kernel, and how such a program is built and linked.

* The layers of the stack: your code, the C library, and the system calls underneath.
* Writing core string and memory functions by hand, and measuring their cost.
* Buffered (`printf`) versus unbuffered (`write`) output.
* Static and dynamic linking, and building against a shared or a static library.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this session you should be able to:

* Explain the layers between a C program and the kernel: application code, C library, and system calls.
* Implement basic string-handling functions (`strlen`, `strcpy`, `strcat`, `memcpy`) and reason about their algorithmic cost.
* Compare buffered (`printf`) and unbuffered (`write`) output, and explain the buffering trade-off from measured data.
* Build a C program as a dynamically-linked executable, a statically-linked executable, and against a shared or a static library.
* Explain the difference between static linking (`.a`, `ar`) and dynamic linking (`.so`), including symbol resolution via the PLT and the GOT.

## Prerequisites and required tools

* Prior knowledge of C syntax: pointers, arrays, functions, basic `<string.h>` usage.
* A Linux environment with `gcc`, `make`, `ar`, `ldd`, `nm`, `objdump`, `size`, `strace` and `/usr/bin/time` installed.
* Comfort with the command line: running commands, redirecting output, reading `man` pages.

Before the session, check that your machine has these tools with the [setup script](../scripts/check-prerequisites.sh):

```console
./scripts/check-prerequisites.sh
```

## Getting the lab archive

Download [`01-software-stack.zip`](https://github.com/cs-pub-ro/operating-systems-sessions/raw/lab-archives/01-software-stack.zip), then unzip it and change into the directory it creates:

```console
unzip 01-software-stack.zip
cd 01-software-stack
```

Work inside that directory for the rest of the session.

## Task order

Demos come first, solved together with the teaching assistant.
Not all demos are necessarily presented — the teaching assistant picks what fits.
Core exercises are then solved individually or in teams, in the numeric order shown.
Bonus exercises are optional: start them if you finish the core exercises, or take them home.

| Order | Task | Type | Objective |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | [`demo-printf-vs-write`](demo-printf-vs-write) | Demo | See why `printf` can be faster *or* slower than `write`, depending on buffering. |
| 2 | [`demo-copy-string`](demo-copy-string) | Demo | Compare `strcat`-based and `strcpy`-based string building. |
| 3 | [`01-string-functions`](01-string-functions) | Core | Implement `strlen`, `strcpy`, `strcat` and `memcpy` from scratch, then measure them. |
| 4 | [`02-stream-ciphers`](02-stream-ciphers) | Core | Build the same program as a dynamic executable, a static executable, a shared library and a static library. |
| 5 | [`bonus-static-vs-dynamic`](bonus-static-vs-dynamic) | Bonus | Package your string functions as `libmystring` and measure static vs dynamic call and start-up cost. |
| 6 | [`bonus-per-stream-cipher-exec`](bonus-per-stream-cipher-exec) | Bonus | Split the cipher program into one dedicated executable per cipher, in all four link formats. |

`bonus-static-vs-dynamic` reuses your solution to `01-string-functions`, and `bonus-per-stream-cipher-exec` reuses the commands from `02-stream-ciphers`, so do the core exercises first.

Each exercise directory has a `README.md` with the task itself.
Where there is also a `FURTHER.md`, it holds optional extensions and questions to dig into once the task is done.
